> Give Claude a dev team in one workspace: one supervisor, four specialists, and a shared build doctrine that produces bulletproof plans before coding starts.
>
> The point is not just that it runs on your Claude subscription. The point is that you stop copy-pasting between sessions, keep context in one place, and let one Claude session act like a supervisor with a real dev team behind it while you can still jump in and talk to any specialist directly.

---

## Why This Exists

I was spending hours doing the same ritual over and over: open one Claude session to shape the idea, another to write the plan, another to review it, another to code it, another to test it. Every handoff meant more copy-paste, more context loss, and more chances for the build to drift.

The Dev Squad is the answer to that problem. Instead of juggling separate chats by hand, you give Claude its own dev team in one place. The supervisor is still just a Claude session, like any other session you would open yourself, except now it knows it has a planner, a plan reviewer, a coder, and a tester it can use on your behalf. You can still intervene directly with any of them whenever you want, but you no longer have to manually orchestrate the whole thing.

The real win is not “multi-agent” by itself. The real win is that the build plan becomes the contract for the whole team. The planner writes a plan with complete, copy-pasteable code. The plan reviewer tears it apart until there are no gaps. Only then does the coder touch the implementation. The tester checks the result against the approved plan instead of guessing what “done” means.

The key insight is still the same: **the plan is the code contract**. The planner does not write a vague spec sheet. The planner writes a plan that is complete enough for the coder to build without asking a single question. That is what makes the builds reliable — by the time coding starts, the biggest decisions should already be made and verified.

That is why the team shares a doctrine: `build-plan-template.md`, `checklist.md`, and the locked `plan.md`. The supervisor can run the team for you, but the quality bar stays the same. Research first. Verify from source. Write complete code in the plan. Do one self-review. Let the plan reviewer challenge it. Only then move to coding and testing.

This project exists because I wanted that whole process in one interface, with one shared context, and a supervisor who can run it for me when I do not want to babysit five different sessions.

If you already vibe code solo with Claude, you are already doing the job of a whole team yourself. The Dev Squad is the “why limit yourself?” version of that workflow. Same Claude. Same chat feel. But now there is a planner, reviewer, coder, and tester coordinated around the same build doctrine so you can get the output quality of a real dev team without losing context every time you switch tasks.

---

## What This Is

The Dev Squad is Claude with its own dev team:

- the **Supervisor** is your default front door
- the **Planner** writes the build plan
- the **Plan Reviewer** pushes on the plan until there are no gaps
- the **Coder** builds the approved plan
- the **Tester** checks the result against the plan and sends fixes back when needed
- the whole team follows the same doctrine: `build-plan-template.md`, `checklist.md`, and the approved `plan.md`
- you can talk to the supervisor by default or jump directly into any specialist chat whenever you want

Today, the current product shape is already visible:

- the supervisor can capture the concept, start the team, pause after review, continue an approved plan, resume stalled planning/review turns, and stop the run
- the specialists keep their own context in the same workspace instead of forcing you to copy/paste between sessions
- there are now two interfaces for the same team:
  - the **Office View** for the full visual dashboard
  - the **Squad View** for a calmer Supervisor-first workspace without the office UI

Internally the app still labels the team as `S`, `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. In the product, think of them as the **Supervisor**, **Planner**, **Plan Reviewer**, **Coder**, and **Tester**.

The longer-term implementation plan for pushing even more authority into the supervisor lives in [SUPERVISOR-BUILD-PLAN.md](SUPERVISOR-BUILD-PLAN.md). The concrete `v0.4` containment plan lives in [SANDBOX-RUNNER-PLAN.md](SANDBOX-RUNNER-PLAN.md). The next UX + headless-mode plan lives in [UI-AND-HEADLESS-PLAN.md](UI-AND-HEADLESS-PLAN.md).

## The Team

| Team Member | What It Does | Internal ID |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Supervisor** | Your default Claude session. Oversees the team, captures the concept, starts work, pauses after review, continues approved plans, and helps when runs stall or get weird. | `S` |
| **Planner** | Chats with you about the concept, researches everything, and writes a build plan with complete code for every file. | `A` |
| **Plan Reviewer** | Reads the planner's work and tears it apart. Asks hard questions. Loops with the planner until there are zero gaps. | `B` |
| **Coder** | Follows the approved plan exactly. Writes every file, installs deps, and builds the project. No improvising. | `C` |
| **Tester** | Reviews the code against the approved plan, runs it, catches bugs, and loops with the coder until everything passes. | `D` |

Each team member is a separate Claude Code session running Claude Opus 4.6. They communicate through structured JSON signals routed by an orchestrator. Restrictions are enforced by a `PreToolUse` hook, but the real product idea is not “a hook-driven pipeline.” It is a supervisor-led dev team that all follows the same build doctrine: the build plan template, the checklist, and the locked plan. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and known limitations.

## How It Works

```
1. Open the viewer
2. Tell the supervisor what you want to build
3. Ask the supervisor to start planning or start the build
4. Let the supervisor manage the team, or jump into any specialist panel yourself
5. Your project is in ~/Builds/
```

The supervisor is the recommended front door now. The old buttons and direct specialist chats are still there, but the product is increasingly shaped around “talk to the supervisor, let the supervisor use the team.”

**Phase 0: Concept** — You talk to the supervisor or the planner. The recommended flow is to tell the supervisor what you want, let the supervisor capture the concept, and then tell the supervisor when to start the team. Strict mode can still ask for Bash approvals later.

**Phase 1: Planning** — The planner reads the build plan template and checklist, researches the concept (web searches, docs, source code), writes `plan.md` with complete, copy-pasteable code for every file, then does one self-review pass before handing it to the plan reviewer. No placeholders.

**Phase 1b: Plan Review** — The plan reviewer reads the plan and sends structured questions back to the planner. They loop until the reviewer is fully satisfied and approves. The plan is locked. No agent can modify it.

**Phase 2: Coding** — The coder reads the locked plan and builds exactly what it says. Every file, every dependency, every line of code.

**Phase 3: Code Review + Testing** — The tester reads the plan and the code. Checks every item. If anything doesn't match or fails, the tester sends issues back to the coder. They loop until the tester approves and all tests pass.

**Phase 4: Deploy** — The finished project is ready.

The plan-review loop between the planner and the plan reviewer catches design gaps before a single line of code is written. The test loop between the coder and the tester catches implementation bugs before anything ships. Each loop has no round limit — they keep going until it's right.

## The Interfaces

### Office View

A pixel art office where 5 agents sit at desks. You watch them work in real-time:

- **Live Feed** — Every event from every agent, timestamped and color-coded
- **Dashboard** — Phase progress, elapsed time, file count, errors
- **Execution Path** — The dashboard now says whether a run is on `Host`, `Isolated Alpha`, or `Host Fallback`
- **Supervisor Update** — A manager-style summary of what the team is doing, what is blocked, and what S needs from you next
- **Current Turn** — Shows which agent turn is active, what it is doing, and whether it looks stalled
- **5-Panel Grid** — Supervisor panel on the left, Planner / Plan Reviewer / Coder / Tester on the right. Each panel shows that agent's activity with auto-scroll. Click any panel to expand.
- **Per-Panel Chat** — Each panel has its own input. Talk directly to any agent.
- **Controls** — `Full Build` / `Plan Only`, `START`, `STOP AFTER REVIEW`, `CONTINUE BUILD`, `RESUME STALLED RUN`, `STOP`, `Reset`, `View Plan`. These now act as fallback controls; you can also ask the supervisor to do the same things in chat.
- **Art style** — The office scene uses a mix of original pixel sprites and CSS-drawn props

When idle, agents wander the office, visit the hookah lounge, and play ping pong.

### Squad View

A simpler Supervisor-first workspace for the same team model:

- **Normal chat feel** — one main Supervisor conversation with the same Planner, Plan Reviewer, Coder, and Tester behind it
- **Specialist tabs** — jump directly into Planner / Reviewer / Coder / Tester when you want a longer back-and-forth
- **Same runtime** — same orchestrator, same runner, same strict-mode approvals, same recovery behavior
- **No office UI required** — better for users who want the dev-team model without the visual dashboard

Open it at [http://localhost:3000/squad](http://localhost:3000/squad).

---

## Requirements

- **Claude Code CLI** — this is the engine. You must have the `claude` command installed and working in your terminal. Install it from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code).
- **Active Claude subscription** — Max, Pro, or Team. All 5 agent sessions run on your subscription. No API key needed.
- **Current `v0.4` sandbox note** — the Docker worker architecture is built and actively integrated, but it is still alpha. If Claude Code subscription auth is unavailable for an isolated worker turn, The Dev Squad falls back to host execution instead of hard-failing the run. We did not abandon isolation; the remaining blocker is reliable subscription auth inside containers.
- **Node.js 22+**
- **pnpm**

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnkf5-ops/the-dev-squad.git
cd the-dev-squad
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for Office View or [http://localhost:3000/squad](http://localhost:3000/squad) for Squad View.

That's it. The viewer handles everything — spawning agents, running the orchestrator, managing builds.

---

## Two Modes

The Dev Squad has two modes, toggled in the dashboard:

### Pipeline Mode (default)

The automated team mode. You describe what you want, and the dev team builds it with minimal involvement from you. In strict mode, the UI can still ask you to approve coder/tester Bash commands.

1. **Reset if Needed** — Clear any previous session.
2. **Talk to the Supervisor or Planner** — The preferred path is to tell the supervisor what you want and let the supervisor manage the team. Direct planner chat still works when you want to hash out the concept yourself.
3. **Choose a Goal** — Pick **Full Build** to run the whole team or **Plan Only** to stop cleanly after the plan reviewer approves the plan. The selected goal also acts as the default when you ask the supervisor to start from chat.
4. **Start from Chat or Button** — Tell the supervisor to start planning or start the build. The old **START** button still works as a fallback control.
5. **Pause from Chat or Button** — During planning or plan review, ask the supervisor to stop after review, or click **STOP AFTER REVIEW** if you want the run to pause after the plan reviewer approves the plan instead of continuing into coding.
6. **Watch** — Each panel auto-scrolls as events come in. Click any panel to expand. The dashboard shows phase progress.
7. **Continue or Recover** — If the run pauses after plan review, ask the supervisor to continue the build or use **CONTINUE BUILD**. If the planner or plan reviewer stalls during planning/review, ask the supervisor to resume the stalled run or use **RESUME STALLED RUN**.
8. **Stop** — Ask the supervisor to stop the run, or click **STOP** at any time.
9. **View Plan** — Once the planner writes the plan, click **View Plan** to read it.
10. **Done** — Your project is in `~/Builds/<project-name>/`.

After the build, chat with any agent for post-build work — fixing bugs, adding features, asking questions.

### Strict Mode

Strict mode is for users who want a human in the loop for shell execution from the build agents.

- **What changes** — Every Bash call from the coder and tester pauses for approval
- **What you see** — The dashboard shows an approval card with the agent, phase, and command description
- **What happens on approve** — The exact approved command gets a one-time grant and runs once
- **What happens on deny** — The agent is told the command was denied and must continue without it or explain what is blocked
- **What does not change** — Strict mode improves practical safety, but it is not OS-level sandboxing. The known hook limitations in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) still apply.
- **What this is not** — Strict mode does not change the team model. It just adds human approval on risky shell execution.

### Manual Mode

You are the orchestrator. 5 panels, 5 Claude sessions, each with a specialty. You talk to whoever you want, whenever you want. No automation, no phases, no pipeline.

- **No START/STOP** — there's no pipeline to run. You direct everything.
- **Claude permission prompts still apply** — manual mode is looser than pipeline mode, but it is not unguarded. Claude Code can still ask for permission inside each direct session.
- **Model picker** — Choose between Opus and Sonnet. Appears only in manual mode.
- **Hand off →** — Each panel has a handoff button. Click it to grab that agent's last response and stage it as context for the next agent you message. One click to pass work between agents.
- **Per-agent chat** — Each panel has its own send button. You can talk to multiple agents at once — they run independently.
- **No pipeline role guardrails** — Agents don't follow the full pipeline templates/checklists automatically. They're direct Claude sessions with expertise labels (planning, code review, coding, testing, diagnostics), and you decide what they do.

Manual mode is useful when you want the multi-panel workspace without the automation — prototyping, brainstorming, or running your own workflow.

## The UI

The screen is split into two sections:

**Top half** — A pixel art office with 5 agents at desks. They animate in real-time as they work. Below the office is a live feed showing every event from every agent. To the right is a dashboard with the mode toggle, agent status, and controls.

**Bottom half** — A 5-panel grid. The **Supervisor** panel spans the left column. The **Planner, Plan Reviewer, Coder, and Tester** panels fill the right in a 2x2 grid. Each panel shows that agent's activity and has its own chat input at the bottom.

### After the Build (Pipeline Mode)

Once the build is complete, you can chat directly with any agent for post-build work. Click on the coder's panel and ask it to fix a bug. Click on the tester's panel and ask it to run more tests. Each agent retains context from the build.

### The Supervisor Panel

The Supervisor panel on the left is the clearest version of the product idea. It is still just a Claude session, like any session you would open yourself, except it knows it has a team and a shared build doctrine behind it. Before a run starts, the supervisor captures the concept locally and waits for an explicit start command instead of freelancing. Once a run exists, the supervisor gets a live team snapshot every time you chat with it: current phase, pipeline status, active turn, recent events, pending approvals, and recommended next actions. The UI now also shows a proactive supervisor update card so you do not have to read raw event logs just to understand what the team is doing, and the supervisor now narrates key transitions in chat too: planning start, review handoff, pauses, resumes, approval waits, and completion. The supervisor can also trigger the core team controls directly from chat: start a run, start plan-only mode, stop after review, continue an approved plan, resume a stalled planning/review turn, or stop the run. If something breaks, stalls, loops, or looks suspicious, ask the supervisor what is happening or tell it what you want the team to do next.

### Controls Reference

| Control | Mode | What It Does |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **PIPELINE / MANUAL** | Both | Toggle between autonomous pipeline and manual orchestration |
| **Model Picker** | Manual | Choose Claude model (Opus or Sonnet) |
| **Full Build / Plan Only** | Pipeline | Chooses whether the supervisor should run the whole team or stop after approved plan review |
| **START** | Pipeline | Fallback button that creates the project directory, spawns the orchestrator, and begins the selected supervisor goal |
| **STOP AFTER REVIEW** | Pipeline | Arms a clean pause once the plan reviewer approves the plan |
| **KEEP RUNNING AFTER REVIEW** | Pipeline | Clears the stop-after-review request and lets the run continue into coding |
| **CONTINUE BUILD** | Pipeline | Resumes a paused plan-only / stopped-after-review run from the approved plan |
| **RESUME STALLED RUN** | Pipeline | Re-launches the orchestrator and resumes a stalled planner/plan-reviewer turn from the saved Claude session |
| **STOP** | Pipeline | Kills orchestrator and all agent sessions immediately |
| **Reset** | Both | Clears all state. In pipeline mode, also stops the orchestrator. |
| **View Plan** | Pipeline | Opens `plan.md` in a modal (appears after the planner writes the plan) |
| **Hand off →** | Manual | Stages the agent's last response as context for the next agent you message |

## Security

Agents are constrained by a `PreToolUse` hook that gates every tool call. The hook prevents accidental lane drift — it is not a security sandbox. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model, known limitations, and a matrix showing what is fixable in-hook vs what requires design changes or OS-level isolation.

This project is meant to provide practical guardrails and a disciplined workflow, not a security sandbox. If you plan to use it on sensitive code or systems, read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) first and decide whether the current threat model fits your environment.

Plain-English status:
- **Pipeline mode** is the more structured path today
- **Manual mode** still has Claude permission prompts, but fewer product-level guardrails
- **Isolated/Docker mode** is built under the hood, but not public-ready yet

| Team Member | Can Write | Can Run Bash | Can Spawn Agents |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Planner (`A`) | `plan.md` only in the current project | No | No |
| Plan Reviewer (`B`) | Nothing | No | No |
| Coder (`C`) | Current project only (except `plan.md`) | Yes (dangerous cmds need approval) | No |
| Tester (`D`) | Nothing | Yes (dangerous cmds need approval) | No |
| Supervisor (`S`) | `~/Builds/` only (no `.claude/`) | Yes (pattern-restricted) | No |

Additional protections:
- `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` are jailed to the current project for the planner/coder and blocked for the reviewer/tester
- Pipeline sessions set `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1`, so Bash `cd` does not persist into later file-edit tool calls
- Plan is locked after the plan reviewer approves — no agent can modify it
- The planner and plan reviewer can use `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` for direct-source research and review
- Fast mode auto-approves safer Bash and asks for riskier Bash
- Strict mode requires approval for every Bash call from the coder and tester
- All sessions default to `--permission-mode auto` for Claude's built-in safety classifier
- Override with `PIPELINE_PERMISSION_MODE` env var (e.g. `plan`, `auto`, or `dangerously-skip-permissions`)

Roadmap:
- **Fast mode** stays the default for autonomy
- **Strict mode** is now available for pipeline runs
- **Isolated mode** will move agents into per-project sandboxes for stronger containment
- **Request-scoped approvals** are live; strict-mode approvals are now tied to explicit request records instead of "latest project wins"
- The concrete implementation plan lives in [SECURITY-ROADMAP.md](SECURITY-ROADMAP.md)

---

## How Agents Communicate

Agents communicate via structured JSON — no text parsing:

```json
// B reviewing A's plan
{ "status": "approved" }
{ "status": "questions", "questions": ["What about error handling?"] }

// D reviewing C's code
{ "status": "approved" }
{ "status": "issues", "issues": ["Missing input validation"] }

// D testing
{ "status": "passed" }
{ "status": "failed", "failures": ["PUT /users returns 500"] }
```

The orchestrator routes these signals between agents and advances the pipeline when an approval is received.

---

## Validation

Useful local checks:

- `pnpm test:hook` — verifies the agent/tool contract against the live approval hook
- `pnpm test:signals` — verifies structured signal parsing for plan review, code review, and test results
- `pnpm dev` — runs the viewer locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
