# Security

## Threat Model

The hook system prevents agents from **accidentally drifting out of their lane** during normal pipeline operation. It is NOT a security sandbox against adversarial or jailbreak-prone models.

If your threat model requires defense against a hostile agent, you need OS-level isolation (containers, chroot, seccomp) — not a bash hook.

The concrete implementation plan for getting there lives in [SECURITY-ROADMAP.md](SECURITY-ROADMAP.md).

## Hook Enforcement Model

Agent permissions are enforced by a `PreToolUse` hook (`pipeline/.claude/hooks/approval-gate.sh`), not by prompts. The hook runs before every tool call for every agent. Prompts provide context — the hook provides guardrails.

Run `pnpm test:hook` after changing the orchestrator or hook rules. It verifies the expected agent/tool contract so hook drift is caught before it reaches a live pipeline run.

## What the Hook Catches

The hook reliably prevents:

- **Accidental `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` outside `~/Builds/`** — path prefix check with trailing slash, canonicalized via `readlink -f`
- **Accidental writes to `.claude/` config via file-edit tools** — case pattern blocks `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` to `.claude/` paths
- **Agent A writing code files via file-edit tools** — only `plan.md` allowed
- **Agents B and D writing via file-edit tools** — all `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` calls blocked
- **Agent C modifying `plan.md` via file-edit tools** — locked after review
- **Agents A and B running Bash** — blocked entirely
- **Any agent spawning sub-agents** — Agent tool blocked for all
- **Path traversal via `..`** — rejected before resolution
- **Unknown agent identity** — rejected if not A/B/C/D/S
- **Unrecognized tools** — deny-by-default catch-all
- **Missing/malformed tool names** — rejected on parse
- **Phase 0 writes by Agent A** — blocked, defaults to blocked if events file missing
- **Symlink-based path escapes** — resolved via `readlink -f`
- **`cd`-then-`Write` drift across Bash commands** — mitigated by setting `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1`, which resets Claude's working directory after each Bash command

## What the Hook Does NOT Catch

These are known, documented limitations that cannot be fully solved with a bash hook:

**Indirect execution bypass (V3 — OPEN)**
Agents with Bash access (C, D, S) can use `python3 -c`, `eval`, `base64`, or other indirect methods to invoke Claude or modify files in ways the pattern filters don't catch. The hook blocks direct `claude -p` and `PIPELINE_AGENT` strings, but cannot prevent all forms of indirect execution. This is fundamentally a blocklist-vs-allowlist problem — you cannot enumerate every way to invoke a program from bash.

**Hardlink bypass (V2/V4 — PARTIALLY MITIGATED)**
The hook blocks `ln` commands and resolves symlinks via `readlink -f`, but `readlink -f` does not detect hardlinks. If a hardlink to an external file exists inside `~/Builds/`, the hook will allow writes to it. The `ln` block prevents agents from creating new hardlinks, but cannot detect pre-existing ones. Creating hardlinks via indirect execution (python, etc.) is also possible.

**Glob-based `.claude/` bypass (V1 — PARTIALLY MITIGATED)**
The hook blocks `mv`/`cp`/`rm` with dot-file glob patterns and direct `.claude` references. However, sufficiently creative glob patterns or indirect shell expansion could evade the filters. Moving the hook outside the agent-writable tree would be the correct fix.

**Cross-project writes via Bash (OPEN)**
Agents A-D are now jailed to their current project directory for `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit`, and pipeline sessions set `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1` so a Bash `cd` does not persist into later file-edit tool calls. However, Bash itself remains a direct write channel for agents C, D, and S. Agent C can still write to sibling projects with shell redirection in a single Bash command, and agent D can still write via Bash despite being read-only at the file-edit-tool layer.

**TOCTOU race conditions**
The hook resolves file paths at check time. Between the check and the actual tool execution, symlinks could be retargeted. This is a fundamental limitation of check-then-act in a separate process.

**WebSearch exfiltration (ACCEPTED RISK)**
Agent A has WebSearch access for research. Search queries go to the internet and could leak small amounts of information. This is an accepted tradeoff — A needs web access to research build concepts. All other agents are blocked from WebSearch and WebFetch.

## What Requires What

Docker is one way to get stronger isolation, but it is not the only way. Containers, chroot jails, VMs, macOS App Sandbox, or other OS-enforced isolation can all serve the same role.

| Issue | Fixable in Hook? | Needs Design / Permission Change? | Needs OS Isolation for Strong Guarantee? |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Cross-project writes via `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` | Yes — **FIXED** | No | No |
| Cross-project writes via Bash | No | Yes — gate all Bash for C/D, remove Bash, or replace it with allowlisted operations | Yes, if unrestricted Bash must remain available |
| Agent A WebSearch exfiltration | No | Yes — reduce, proxy, or remove web access | No |
| Indirect execution via `python3 -c`, `eval`, base64, etc. | No | Yes — remove Bash, require approval for all Bash, or replace shell access with allowlisted operations | Yes, if Bash must remain available |
| Hardlink bypass | Partial mitigation only | Yes — move protected files out of agent-writable trees and reduce shell/file authority | Yes, if you need a reliable guarantee |
| TOCTOU race between check and tool execution | No | Partial mitigation only | Yes |

In short:

- **Fix in hook:** cross-project writes through `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit`
- **Fix by changing permissions/product design:** Bash-mediated writes, indirect execution, and WebSearch risk
- **Needs OS-level isolation for a strong guarantee:** hardlinks and TOCTOU, and Bash-mediated escapes if Bash remains available

## Current Permission Matrix

The `Write` column below refers to file-edit tools (`Write`, `Edit`, `NotebookEdit`), not shell redirection inside Bash.

| Agent | Read | Write | Bash | WebSearch | WebFetch | Agent Tool |
|-------|------|-------|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| S | Anywhere | `~/Builds/` only (no `.claude/`) | Yes (pattern-restricted) | No | No | No |
| A | Anywhere | `plan.md` only in the current project under `~/Builds/` (no Phase 0) | No | Yes | No | No |
| B | Anywhere | No | No | No | No | No |
| C | Anywhere | Current project under `~/Builds/` (no `plan.md`, no `.claude/`) | Yes (pattern-restricted) | No | No | No |
| D | Anywhere | No | Yes (pattern-restricted) | No | No | No |

Pipeline sessions also set `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1`, which resets Claude's working directory after each Bash command. This mitigates `cd`-then-`Write` drift, but it does not make Bash read-only.

## Recommended Hardening (Future)

The build plan is in [SECURITY-ROADMAP.md](SECURITY-ROADMAP.md). In short:

1. **`v0.3`: Strict mode** — first cut shipped; C/D Bash now supports "approve every call," but the approval flow still assumes a single active pipeline run
2. **`v0.4`: Sandboxed execution** — run agents in containers or equivalent per-project sandboxes
3. **`v0.5`: Host-owned policy** — move approvals and enforcement outside the repo so agents cannot disable them by editing project files
